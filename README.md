# More Creeps and Weirdos 

This is a revival of the original More Creeps and Weirdos mod from Minecraft 1.2.5.<br>
You can check the original mod [here](https://www.minecraftforum.net/forums/mapping-and-modding-java-edition/minecraft-mods/1272354-1-2-5-morecreeps-weirdos-v2-62-slot-machines-old).

--------------

As you explore the world with this mod, you'll meet many new faces! You might encounter a giant baby or the infamous Sneaky Sal, who has no patience for scammers. You'll also find Blorps, creatures who hate each other but drop delicious Blorp Cola when defeated.

You can tame friendly Guinea Pigs and Hot Dogs to become your loyal companions. They will risk their lives to protect you! You can level them up and give them armor. Once they reach their maximum level, they will build you a beautiful Guinea Pig Hotel or a Hot Dog Heaven, filled with special supplies for your pets!

You will also discover new structures. A mysterious Pyramid spawns in deserts, filled with bedrock. The only way to remove it is to navigate the maze inside and defeat the mummy at the end. There is also a Battle Castle with multiple floors of loot. Be careful, guards will try to protect their king! Fight your way to the top, and if you collect all the gems and defeat the king, you will be rewarded with a beautiful (and strong) gem sword!
